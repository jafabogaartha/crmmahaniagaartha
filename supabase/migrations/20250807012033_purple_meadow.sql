  # Fix RLS policy for leads table

  1. Changes
    - Disable RLS on leads table to allow public form submissions
    - The application already handles authorization at the UI level
    - This matches the approach used for products, packages, and targets tables

  2. Security
    - Application-level authorization is maintained through UI restrictions
    - Public forms need to be able to insert leads without authentication
